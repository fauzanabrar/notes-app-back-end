This project is a submission for Dicoding, which involves creating a robust CRUD backend for a To-Do List application using Hapi.js. The project also includes deploying the database to Amazon Web Services' EC2 using the Amazon Redshift engine, which is powered by PostgreSQL. This approach provides a scalable and secure solution for managing the data and allows for seamless access to the To-Do List from any device or location.
